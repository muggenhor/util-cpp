# RDATA filled with this repeated:
#                 16-bit    OPTION-CODE
# followed by     16-bit    OPTION-LENGTH
# followed by length-octets OPTION-DATA

# Except that an off-by one error leaves the 0x55 bytes as gaps that should have been read as part
# of the OPTION-CODE but aren't read at all. This propagates and moves the reading of OPTION-LENGTH
# as well, causing out of bounds access for the last OPTION-LENGTH.
